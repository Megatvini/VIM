Description: Calculates post-hoc variable importance measures for multivariate random forests. 
  These are given by split improvement for splits defined by feature j as measured using user-defined (ie training or test) examples.
  Importances can also be calculated on a per-outcome variable basis using the change in predictions for each split. Both measures can be
  optionally threshholded to include only splits that produce statistically significant changes as measured by an F-test.
