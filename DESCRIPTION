Description: Calculates post-hoc variable importance measures for multivariate random forests. 
These are given by split improvement for splits defined by feature j as measured using user-defined (ie training or test) examples.
Importances can also be calculated on a per-outcome variable basis using the change in predictions for each split. Both measures can be
optionally threshholded to include only splits that produce statistically significant changes as measured by an F-test.
